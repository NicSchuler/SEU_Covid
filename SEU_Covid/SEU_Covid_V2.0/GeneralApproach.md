## General Approach

This application shall assess the swiss federal council's decision making in terms of measures against the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. We therefore only use data, which was available on the decision day, March 16, 2020.

The two key aspects for this decision are assumed to be:

* Health impact
* Economic impact

In order to both components properly, they will be modelled separately and will be brought together in a utility function afterwards.
